I want a modern web site for a company of an individual master who is providing hair style services. Her name is Daniela Mancos

The website should be in Romanian (by default):

web page should be split in 4 child pages:

1) main page:

some attractive description and photos

interactive style

stylish button to the next pages

2) Register for a hair style session page:

a calendar for online bookings, using GOOGLE calendar or other tool like this in backend, where users can automatically select a day and book it (no Saturdays and Sundays allowed for booking). Once booked the record should be recorded in a database in backend and notification to be sent to nicolaebordei3@gmail.com. Bookings should be allowed only starting with the next working day.

3) Register to trainings page:.

provide a list of 5 mock trainings and option to book a spot.

4) Contact

add contact details:
some mock telephone number and e-mail.

Style of all the pages should be aligned.


Style should be modern and looks like the ones from Hostinger web builder.

Site should work fine on localhost and be able to be moved to Netlify easy.

The pictures from /static/img folder should be used on the pages -either as background or just simply.
